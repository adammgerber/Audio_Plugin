## Audio Engineering Basics 

This is just some basic information to understand before diving into this project

#### Sound 
- The brain's interpretation of an auditory stimulous 
- Sound pressure waves are what trael through the air.
- When sound pressure waves hit the ears, go into eardrums and your brain receives that information, that is sound. 
- It is not sound until your brain actually receives that information.

#### Amplitude
- Simply put amplitude is volume 
- The unit of measurement for amplitude is Decibels (dB) 
- named after Alexander Graham Bell. Decibel = 1/10th of a bell 
- generates a positive "compression" and a negative "rarefaction" 

#### Audio cycle
- The sound wave starts at 0° and has a positive voltage (compression) until 180° 
- It then travels in a negative voltage (rarefaction) until it reaches 360° 
- This completes the cycle and is known as the "wavelength" 

#### Frequency(Hz) 
- how many full cycles per second (CPS) 
- Humans can hear 20Hz - 20,000Hz

#### Stereo vs Mono 
- Stereo = multi-channel 
- Mono = single-channel
